# Skullyflower Admin

React app with node back end for doing regular site updates to Skullyflower.com, for the galleries,
products, and blog.

## To make updates to the Blog or Shop,

1. Navigate to the desired page.
2. Click edit in the entry you want to adjust and make edits in the popup.
3. Click the Save button and the json file will be updated and copied to the build directory for
   immediate testing in staging. (this will likely change in the near future to require a rebuild
   instead.)

## To make updates to the Blog or Shop

1. Navigate to the desired page.
2. Click the add new one button and create the entry.
3. When you save the popup closes and the new entry should appear at the top of the list. The json
   file will be updated and copied to the build directory for immediate testing in staging. (this
   will likely change in the near future to require a rebuild instead.)

## To update a gallery:

1. Upload images. They'll be resized to 750px wide and 450 wide automatically.
2. Select where they need to go using the dropdowns.
3. Regenerate the gallery JSON. (This will change to be automatic soon)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn admin` which will run the admin, admin server and skullyflower dev site all locally

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)
for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for
more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time.
This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel,
ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except
`eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this
point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle
deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this
tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
